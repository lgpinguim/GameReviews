Work in progress.
The main idea here is to have a C# application that will be regularly updated with technologies I am studing and using in a professional manner. 
Backend: .NET/C#
Frontend: Still thinking if I will do a UI for this
Databases: SQL Server (relational), CosmosDB (NoSQL), Redis (caching) | Will try to make it configurable to use both. 
Infrastructure: Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes
Cloud: Azure ecosystem
